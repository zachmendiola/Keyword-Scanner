# Keyword-Scanner
Scans text for certain keywords, pertaining to job searching. This project was born out of the job search.
Needing to identify what skills were necessary for various jobs, I wanted to make an application that made searching easier.

To use:
1. Clone the repository
2. Extract the repository
3. Follow the filepath downloads\Key Word Search\Key Word Search\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\Key Word Search.exe
4. Copy and paste the job posting into the first textbox.
5. Click Load
6. Click Go!
7. The output will list how many times certain keywords are used in the posting. 

Keywords consist of but are not limited to:
software, development, engineer, c#, c++, python, java, javascript and many others.
